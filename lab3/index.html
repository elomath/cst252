		<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your
				computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I had a slight issue with getting my image to show up on the homepage
				but using inspect element helped me tink with it until it appeared.
				Otherwise, the lab went very smooth and without issue.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here is my screenshot of the file structure set up earlier in this lab.</p>
