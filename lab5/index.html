		<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I've been struggling to make the js script output display. I tried
				changing the name of the js to see if it would fix anything but nothing
				chnaged. It's most likely a formatting error but im unsure as to what it
				is. I rewatched the lecture from monday and discovered I made the same
				mistake as Nely, putting writein instead of writeln.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I got everything running on the page but its all a day late so
				hopefully I can figure out these issues sooner.</p>
