		<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Js Output won't display again, its not a typo issue though.
				In the console it says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid shorthand property
				initializer lab.js:12". This probably means its an issue with line 12
			 	of my js but I don't know what the issue is, I copied the lab example
			 	exactly.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The results are intended to display below however they are not outputting correctly.</p>
