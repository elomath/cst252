		<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping
				into coding.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The only issue we had was getting into the mindset of pseudocoding and
				devising what we wanted to do for our example tasks</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>These are the resulting lists of pseudocode we created to match the
				prompt of this project.</p>

		<h2> Pseudocode Everday Task </h2>
			<p> = Making Boiled Eggs </p>
				<ul>

		<h2> Pseudocode Computer Task </h2>
			<p> = Maze Solving Game </p>
				<ul>
					<li> 1. display maze path </li>
					<li> 2.	detect player input </li>
					<li> 3. move based on input </li>
					<li> 4. display new paths possible </li>
					<li> 5. move through maze until goal reached </li>
